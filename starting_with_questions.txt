Answer the following questions and provide the SQL queries used to find the answer.

    
**Question 1: Which cities and countries have the highest level of transaction revenues on the site?**


SQL Queries:
SELECT DISTINCT (tas.country), tas.city, MAX (ta.unit_price * tp.orderedquantity)
AS max_transactionrevenues 
FROM temp_all_sessions tas
JOIN temp_products tp
ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
JOIN temp_analytics ta
ON tas.visitid = ta.visitid
WHERE ta.unit_price * tp.orderedquantity = (SELECT max (ta.unit_price * tp.orderedquantity)											
					    FROM temp_all_sessions tas
					    JOIN temp_products tp
					    ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
					    JOIN temp_analytics ta
					    ON tas.visitid = ta.visitid)		
GROUP BY tas.country, tas.city, ta.unit_price * tp.orderedquantity;


Answer:
To get the cities and countries with the highest level of transaction revenues, the 'totaltransactionrevenue'
column in the All_sessions table could not be used because only 81 values out of 15134 were given, which would not give
a meaningful data. Therefore to  get the transaction revenue, the unit_price from Analytics Table, orderedquantity from
Products Table with the corresponding cities and countries from All_sessions table.

The country and Cities with the highest revenue are;
Country = United States of America, City = Chigaco
Country = United States of America, City = Newyork 
Highest transaction revenue = 2,199,650 USD



**Question 2: What is the average number of products ordered from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:
SELECT DISTINCT (tas.city), tas.country, CAST(AVG(tp.orderedquantity) as numeric (5,0)) 
                AS avg_orderedquantity
FROM temp_all_sessions tas 
JOIN temp_products tp
ON tp.productsku = tas.productsku
JOIN temp_analytics ta
ON tas.visitid = ta.visitid
WHERE tp.orderedquantity >0
GROUP BY tas.city, tas.country
ORDER BY tas.city, tas.country


Answer:
From each city and country, the average number of products ordered from visitors (visitors that
visited the page to place an order = visitid) are partitioned by each city and country, giving a 
total of 240 unique city and countries.
The ALL_Session table, Analytics and Products table were joined using Productsku as the unique
column between all_sessions and Products table. Aswell as visitid as the unique column between
All_sessions table and analytics table.
filtering out ordered quantity < 0 (i.e no order was made).



**Question 3: Is there any pattern in the types (product categories) of products ordered 
from visitors in each city and country?**


SQL Queries:
1. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory

2. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Apparel%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory;

3. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Apparel/Women%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory

4. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Apparel/Men%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory

5. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Apparel/Kid%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory

6. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Accessories%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory


7. SELECT DISTINCT(tas.productcategory), tas.city, tas.country, SUM(tp.orderedquantity)
                  OVER (PARTITION BY tas.productcategory) AS sum_orderedquantity
   FROM temp_all_sessions tas
   JOIN temp_products tp
   ON tas.productsku = tp.productsku
   WHERE tas.productcategory LIKE '%Home/Electronics%' AND tp.orderedquantity > 0
   ORDER BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productcategory

Answer:
The prominent pattern is the Hierachical categorization of Products

1. 2627 unique types of products that is used in Homes were ordered by visitors in
   each city and country.
2. 909 unique types of products that are apparels for home use were ordered by visitors in each
   city and country.
3. 186 unique types of products that are women's apparel for home use were ordered by visitors
   in each city and country. 
4. 436 unique types of products that are men's apparel for home use were ordered by visitors
   in each city and country.
5. 105 unique types of products that are kid's apparel for home use were ordered by visitors
   in each city and country
6. 297 unique types of products that are accessories for home use were ordered by visitors
   in each city and country
7. 253 unique types of products that are electronics for home use were ordered by visitors
   in each city and country




**Question 4: What is the top-selling product from each city/country? Can we find any 
pattern worthy of noting in the products sold?**


SQL Queries:
WITH ranked_products AS(
SELECT tas.city, tas.country, tas.productname, MAX(ta.unit_sold) AS max_unit_sold,
		RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY tas.city, tas.country ORDER BY MAX(ta.unit_sold) DESC)
		AS product_rank
FROM temp_all_sessions tas
JOIN temp_analytics ta ON tas.visitid = ta.visitid
GROUP BY tas.country, tas.city, tas.productname
)
SELECT city, country, productname, max_unit_sold, product_rank
FROM ranked_products
WHERE product_rank = 1 AND max_unit_sold != 0
ORDER BY max_unit_sold DESC 


Answer:
To get the top selling Products from each city/country the All_sessions and Analytical
tables were joined, considering Visitid column as a unique column between them because
for a product to be sold, it needed to have been ordered by a visitor who vivited the site
(visitid).
There for the Maximum unit sold was ranked for each city/country. Using CTE to to create a 
nested query for infering purpose.



**Question 5: Can we summarize the impact of revenue generated from each city/country?**

SQL Queries:
SELECT DISTINCT (tas.city), tas.country, SUM (ta.revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY tas.city, tas.country) 
AS total_rvn_from_each_city
FROM temp_all_sessions tas
JOIN temp_analytics ta
ON tas.fullvisitorid = ta.fullvisitorid
where revenue != 0
ORDER BY total_rvn_from_each_city DESC

Answer:
From the Analysis, we can deduce that United state has the highest generated revenue, compared
to the occurence of other countries in the output.

Summarizing the impact of revenue generated from each city or country, typically 
involves analyzing and understanding the significance of revenue in relation to specific 
locations. This analysis can help identify key revenue-generating areas, assess the contribution 
of different cities or countries to overall revenue, and make informed decisions regarding 
resource allocation, market strategies, and business expansion.

With this summary, businesses can gain insights into the relative performance
of different regions, identify potential growth opportunities, and optimize their 
operations accordingly. It provides a way to evaluate the effectiveness of revenue generation 
strategies and understand the role of different locations in driving overall financial outcomes.
